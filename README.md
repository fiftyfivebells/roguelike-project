# roguelike-project

This is a basic roguelike game in Java, created by with the assistance of [this tutorial](http://trystans.blogspot.com/2016/01/roguelike-tutorial-00-table-of-contents.html). I will generally follow along pretty closely, only changing little things here and there.

My intent here is to get some familiarity with the general concepts and structure of a roguelike game, then use that experience to create my own. Below is a list of possible changes I plan to make, or at least consider, when I start my own. I'll add to this list as I go.

* more square dungeon rooms instead of random shapes
* different types of maps (caves, dungeon rooms, forest, etc)
* possibly use more interfaces to provide behavior to creatures
